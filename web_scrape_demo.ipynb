    "Before we dive into code, let's understand what web scraping involves. Think of web scraping like reading a newspaper, but instead of using your eyes, we're teaching a computer to \"read\" the webpage and extract specific information.\n",

    "**The Process:**\n",
    "1. **Send Request** → Like asking for a specific newspaper\n",
    "2. **Receive HTML** → Getting the raw newspaper content\n",
    "3. **Parse Structure** → Understanding the layout and finding articles\n",
    "4. **Extract Data** → Pulling out just the headlines we want\n",
    "5. **Store Results** → Organizing our collected headlines\n",

    "- **Data Quality Impact:** Real data often has more variety and noise\n",
    "- **Generalization:** Models trained on diverse real data often generalize better\n",
    "- **Scale Effects:** More data usually means better performance, but quality matters too\n",
